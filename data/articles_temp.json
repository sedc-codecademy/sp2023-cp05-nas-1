    "content": "\n<p><strong>Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad’ has suggested Russian technicians may have damaged jets that were later gifted to Ukraine</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter jets belonging to the Slovak army may have been intentionally sabotaged by Russian engineers who worked on them before they were given to Ukraine, Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad’ claimed on Friday.</p>\n<p>As reported by Euractiv, Nad’s statement came after former Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico criticized the government in Bratislava for giving up the valuable aircraft to Kiev.</p>\n<p>Slovakia retired its fleet of MiG-29s last summer as most of the planes were not operational. Last month, the Slovak government announced that it would be giving 10 MiGs with engines and another three without engines to Ukraine’s forces. Four of the jets have already been delivered and are patrolling the skies over Kharkov, according to Ukrainian officials, while the other nine are expected to arrive in the near future.</p>\n<p>However, Nad’ now suggests that the jets may have been intentionally damaged by Russian technicians who had worked on the planes at the Sliac air base in Slovakia until last year.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.03/thumbnail/641474912030274a226524c2.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: MIG - 29 fighter jet.\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/russia/573140-dispose-old-jets-ukraine/\">NATO states using Ukraine to dispose of old weapons – Kremlin</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p><em>“Even the police were investigating it, based on our suspicions. There were parts in the engines of the aircraft that Slovak technicians accessed, and then there were parts that Russian technicians only accessed. The defects appeared only in those parts accessed by Russians,”</em> Naď said. </p>\n<p>He added that while the investigation has failed to prove any ill intent on the part of the engineers, the defense ministry <em>“felt a loss of confidence in the Russian technicians”</em> because mistakes kept appearing<em> “in places only they could get to.”</em></p>\n<p>Slovakia’s former highest-ranking pilot, Lubomir Svoboda, also suggested there was<em> “poor”</em> workmanship on the jets. <em>“We took over an engine from them that was supposed to last 350 hours. And in the end, it only flew 70 hours. What can we make of that?”</em> he said.</p>\n<p>Russia’s embassy in Slovakia, meanwhile, has criticized officials for sending the jets to Ukraine, arguing that the move was <em>“illegal”</em> because it required Moscow’s approval under bilateral agreements. It also warned that such deliveries could lead to<em> “an unpredictable and dangerous escalation of the conflict.” </em></p>\n<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stated that the MiG-29s would be destroyed by Russian forces just like any other Western weapons sent to the country. Peskov also said he had the impression that Kiev’s allies were using Ukraine to simply <em>“dispose of old hardware that they do not need anymore.”</em></p>\n",

The appeal evokes the policy of détente of the Cold War, arguing that it is as relevant as ever. </p>\n<p>The author and signatories conclude by calling on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, with whom many of them share a party allegiance, to join forces with the likes of France, Brazil, China, India and Indonesia in a bid to bring about a swift cessation of hostilities in Ukraine.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p><strong>The former president is correct to describe the US as a ‘nation in decline,’ and he is the main symptom of this decline</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>Donald Trump’s 25-minute speech delivered at his Mar-a-Lago compound on Wednesday, following his indictment on felony charges in New York, marks his dramatic return to the center of American politics. </p>\n<p>After languishing in the doldrums for the past few years, Trump is now back in the game with a vengeance – thanks to the decision by New York Attorney General Alvin Bragg to charge him with 34 counts of falsifying business records. Bragg’s controversial decision to prosecute Trump may well turn out to be one of the most consequential misjudgements by a public official in recent American history.</p>\n<p>Trump’s speech on Wednesday was a bravura performance. In apocalyptic tones – <em>“our country is going to hell”</em> – Trump painted a picture of a corrupt, crime-ridden and weak America, foolishly promoting a dangerous and unnecessary conflict in Ukraine, hurtling towards self-destruction. The US, Trump asserted, is a “<em>failing nation … a nation in decline.”</em> </p>\n<p>Trump himself is at the center of this grim prognosis proclaiming himself as the only politician who can “<em>save our country.</em>” In order to prevent this, he claimed, the elites responsible for America’s current state of decline, including the Democrats, the FBI, the Department of Justice, George Soros, Facebook and Twitter, have now conspired to use a corrupt legal system to thwart his reelection. <em>“They can’t beat us at the ballot box so they try and beat us through the law,”</em> he said.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.04/thumbnail/6429f071203027418b06d273.jpeg\" alt=\"RT\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/574046-trump-triples-lead-desantis-indictment/\">Most Republicans back Trump as 2024 candidate – poll</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>It is hardly surprising that Trump should turn his destructive ire upon the American legal system. He has always held contempt for the rule of law. Who can forget his <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-decision-trump-takes-credit-for-supreme-court-abortion-ruling.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">boasting of having stacked the Supreme Court</a> and his subsequent denunciation of his own appointees when they refused to legally sanction his claim that the 2020 election had been stolen? But in this speech, he went further than he has ever gone before. </p>\n<p>As to the charges brought by Attorney General Bragg, Trump claimed that “<em>there is no case</em>” and that Bragg – who he branded “<em>a criminal”</em> – knew that there was no case. He described the judge presiding over the case as a “<em>Trump hating judge with a Trump hating wife… whose daughter worked for Kamala Harris.</em>” According to the former President, the entire prosecution is something “<em>right out of the old Soviet Union.”</em></p>\n<p>However, Trump’s denunciation of the legal system did not end there. He described the seizure of documents from Mar-a-Lago by the FBI as <em>“illegal”</em> and part of a campaign of <em>“persecution”</em> and <em>“harassment”</em> against him and his family.</p>\n<p>The former president dismissed the investigation into alleged fraudulent practices by Trump’s businesses in New York as <em>“a persecution not an investigation”</em> and accused Attorney General Leticia James of being a “<em>racist in reverse”</em> and a tool of the Democrats.</p>\n<p>Trump went on to describe the Attorney General in Atlanta who is currently investigating him in relation to alleged electoral fraud during the 2020 election as a “<em>racist Democrat Attorney General.”</em></p>\n<p>Bragg’s prosecution, the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago and the other pending investigations, are, according to Trump, all aspects of a vast legal conspiracy – “<em>our justice system has become lawless</em>” – designed to destroy his prospects of being re-elected President in 2024.</p>\n<p>It is a measure of America’s irreversible decline as a functioning liberal democracy that a person who publicly expresses such views could be a serious candidate for the Presidency. Trump’s encouragement of the January 6 riots and his persistent attempts to overturn the 2020 election result proved that he had absolute contempt for the democratic process. This week’s speech proves that he has a similar contempt for the legal system and rule of law. No previous American president – not even Richard Nixon in his darkest days – would have even thought of behaving in such a manner. </p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.04/thumbnail/642c80ec2030274738539c63.jpg\" alt=\"Former US President Donald Trump sits in a New York City courtroom, flanked by his lawyers, as he's arraigned on Tuesday on 34 criminal counts.\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/574188-trump-pleads-not-guilty/\">Trump responds to New York criminal charges</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>Two other aspects of Trump’s speech are noteworthy. He repeated his standard critique of Joe Biden and the Democrats as having destroyed America and reduced it to a global laughing stock – focusing on illegal immigration, increasing crime in large cities, inflation and the weakening of the military. He described the Biden family as “<em>criminals and crooks”</em> and made much of Hunter Biden’s various transgressions and the fact that he had not been prosecuted.</p>\n<p>More importantly, Trump strongly criticized America’s involvement in the conflict in Ukraine. He claims the conflict would never have occurred if he had been President, and he asserted that Biden was running the risk of provoking an “<em>all out nuclear war.”</em> He also blamed Biden for having brought about a rapprochement between Russia and China that has weakened America’s position globally.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Trump’s prospects of winning the Republican nomination and winning the Presidential election in 2024 have been energized by the Bragg prosecution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/4zul6phwv0/Yahoo_20230331_Toplines_Crosstabs_Joined.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polls</a> this week show that Trump has a commanding lead over Ron DeSantis as the preferred Republican Presidential nominee, with other candidates, including Mike Pence and Nikki Haley, having failed to gain virtually any support whatsoever. It is now clear that the primary will be a two-horse race.</p>\n<p>Trump’s lead over DeSantis can be expected to widen, especially if the Bragg prosecution fails. And a bungled prosecution could very well catapult Trump into the White House in 2024.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, that prosecutors must prove that Trump personally falsified various documents with the intention to defraud. Staff who’ve worked with him before say he has an <a href=\"https://time.com/6215419/trump-legal-trouble-key-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aversion to putting anything in writing</a>, so proving that he was personally responsible for the falsification of documents, and that he had the requisite intention, will not be an easy task. Many legal experts, including Trump’s opponents, have expressed doubts as to whether Bragg’s prosecution will result in a conviction.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.04/thumbnail/642cdc4f20302748d933b3e8.jpg\" alt=\"Former President Donald Trump speaks at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, April 4, 2023.\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/574198-trump-speech-charges-arrest/\">Trump condemns arrest in Mar-a-Lago speech</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>It will be interesting to see if Trump seeks to delay the Bragg prosecution or to have it expedited. In either case, he will use the prosecution to turbocharge his campaigns for the Republican nomination and the presidency, and any additional prosecutions that may be brought against him will likely be used to similar effect.</p>\n<p>It is also relevant to note that the Bragg prosecution involves essentially trivial matters. After all, has no American President ever misused campaign funds in the past? This is far less serious, for example, than the alleged electoral fraud in Georgia in which Trump was personally involved, as his infamous telephone conversation with the Georgia Secretary of State shows. Trump would be in far graver difficulties if he had been prosecuted in relation to this matter or his involvement in the January 6 riots.</p>\n<p>It is easy to dismiss the Mar-a-Lago speech as the conspiracy-ridden ravings of a demagogue.  That, however, would be to seriously underestimate Trump’s appeal to a substantial and growing portion of the American electorate – namely all those that have been left behind by globalization. He also personifies many of the grosser aspects of American popular culture, and this makes his political rhetoric extraordinarily effective in contemporary America.</p>\n<p>It must also be conceded that, stripped of its conspiracy theory underpinnings, much of Trump’s critique of Biden and contemporary America is essentially correct – and the fact that Trump is clearly incapable of solving the problems he draws attention to does not invalidate his criticisms. </p>\n<p>This is especially so in relation to Trump’s opposition to Biden’s fervent commitment to perpetuating the conflict in Ukraine. Popular support for Biden’s continued aid to Ukraine is decreasing, and Trump’s promise to end the conflict will no doubt attract large numbers of new voters to his cause. </p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.04/thumbnail/642bebaa20302730c46fd0c0.jpg\" alt=\"Former US President Donald Trump waves as he arrives at Trump Tower in New York on April 3, 2023.\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/574128-trump-charges-bumped-felony/\">Charges against Trump ‘bumped up’ – media</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>Trump’s energy, belief in his own cause, and campaigning ability stand in stark contrast to Biden – who is becoming progressively more fragile and looks like a doddering politician going through the motions. Anyone who doubts this should compare Trump’s Mar-a-Lago speech with Biden’s unimpressive speech delivered after the recent Nashville school shooting.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens next year, the apparently terminal decline that has beset America in recent decades – so graphically and not inaccurately described by Trump this week – is certain to endure.</p>\n<p>Trump’s continuing attacks on the basic institutions that underlie American liberal democracy will no doubt intensify over the coming months and can only further weaken those already fragile bodies, and his campaign for the presidency will only divide and coarsen American politics and society.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump was correct to describe America as “<em>a nation in decline”</em> this week, but he omitted that the most obvious and egregious symptom of that irreversible decline is none other than Trump himself.</p>\n",

It forces us to take countermeasures to ensure [Russia’s] security, both tactically and strategically,”</em> Peskov explained.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.03/thumbnail/6425a70d85f54007ad2dfdc4.jpg\" alt=\"Russian servicemen aim a BM-21 Grad multiple launch rocket system at combat positions in the course of Russia's military operation in Ukraine, at the unknown location.\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/russia/573872-crucial-strategic-choice-in-ukraine/\">Sergey Poletaev: Why the battle for a ‘strategically unimportant’ town may decide the outcome of the Ukraine conflict</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>He pointed out, however, that Russia’s issue with Finland is ‘fundamentally different'’ to the conflict with Kiev and that, unlike Ukraine, the Nordic nation has never been “anti-Russian” or had any disputes with Moscow.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, in response to Finland joining NATO, Moscow has already vowed to boost its defense capabilities in Russia’s western and northwestern regions. It is not yet clear, however, in what specific form.</p>\n<p><em>“If other NATO members deploy their forces and equipment on Finnish territory, we will take additional steps to ensure Russia’s security,”</em> Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko warned the day before Helsinki’s accession to the alliance.</p>\n<p>Work is already being done to that end. For example, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced earlier this year that a new army corps will be formed on the border with Finland, in Karelia and the region around St. Petersburg, as part of the effort to bolster Russia’s armed forces in that part of the country. The corps will consist of three motorized rifle divisions and two airborne divisions of the Russian Airborne Forces.</p>\n<p>According to military observer Colonel Mikhail Khodaryonok, Moscow will focus on strengthening ground and coastal troops in the region and expanding the presence of Russian missile troops and artillery.</p>\n<p><em>“It is likely that these new formations will include brigades operating Iskander-M missile systems and heavy artillery brigades carrying nuclear ammunition,”</em> noted Khodaryonok. </p>\n    <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.04/original/642eda2a20302717893128c3.jpg\"><figcaption>\n                                    A launcher deploys during a special exercise of the Iskander-M tactical missile systems in the Western Military District of Ivanovo Region.\n                \n                <span class=\"copyright\">\n                       ©  Sputnik/Konstantin Morozov                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption></figure><p>According to the expert, should things escalate to a stage where Russia has to plan combat operations in the region, Moscow will most likely consider long-range high-precision strikes on targets in Finland and Sweden, such as can be carried out by long-range aircraft carrying cruise missiles or naval forces carrying Kalibr missiles.</p>\n<p><em>“Given NATO’s superiority in terms of conventional arms, Moscow would do well to consider planting nuclear land mines along the state border with the alliance’s new member states.</em></p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.12/thumbnail/63aadc6385f5407f4c77c3fc.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO.\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/russia/568940-finland-new-champion-of-russophobia/\">Cold embrace of enmity: How one of Moscow's closest neighbors betrayed its neutrality and national interests to confront Russia</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p><em>“Still, any defensive operation of this scale must be approved first.

But in this case, national defense and security interests clearly take priority,”</em> summarized Khodaryonok.</p>\n<h2>Why Finland wants it</h2>\n<p>Last May, Finland’s then prime minister, Sanna Marin, said in an interview with Corriere della Sera that the question of NATO deploying nuclear weapons or opening bases in Finland was not part of Helsinki’s membership negotiations with the alliance.</p>\n<p><em>“Nobody will come to us to impose nuclear weapons or permanent bases on us if we don't want them. So I think that this topic is not on the agenda,”</em> she said. According to the prime minister, NATO is not interested in stationing its forces or nuclear weapons in Finland.</p>\n<p>Marin emphasized that Finland has invested heavily in its security as <em>“a small country”</em> that <em>“has an aggressive neighbor,”</em> but called the application for NATO membership <em>“an act of peace”</em> rather than war. <em>“It’s about war never returning to Finland,”</em> said Marin, who asserted that Helsinki <em>“will always try to find diplomatic solutions to any problems.”</em></p>\n    <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.04/original/642eda6f203027293e4a2918.jpg\"><figcaption>\n                                    Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin arrives for the first day of a EU leaders Summit at The European Council Building in Brussels on October 20, 2022.\n                \n                <span class=\"copyright\">\n                       ©  Kenzo TRIBOUILLARD / AFP                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption></figure><p>Yet, it is not peace that Helsinki is likely to secure for itself by joining NATO, but the loss of its status and sovereignty, according to military journalist Ivan Konovalov.</p>\n<p>He told RT: <em>“Up to now, Finland enjoyed a very special status of a neutral state on the international scene. Even back in the Cold War times, when the USSR was in a standoff with NATO, the neutral stance made Finland stand out as a player on the global scene, unlike many others. But now it’s over. It’s going to be a political death for Finland that will now become just one of the many nations doing the bidding of Washington. It will lose its political uniqueness and get assimilated by NATO.”</em> </p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.04/thumbnail/642f173b2030271c9f02c301.jpg\" alt=\"RT\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/sport/574322-world-chess-championship-2023-preview/\">Checkmate: Russian and Chinese stars prepare for tense stand-off in Kazakhstan</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>According to Alexander Khramchikhin, this decision is against Finland’s own interests because it will only undermine the nation’s security, even if Helsinki thinks it’s going to be the other way round. <em>“This has been an irrational decision inspired by fear,”</em> he believes. </p>\n<h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>\n<p>The relationship between Moscow and Helsinki has taken a turn for the worse recently, and as Vladimir Bruter sees it, it’s not going to get any better.</p>\n<p><em>“The only chance to build a balanced relationship is for the West to stop talking about Russia as a force to contain. Russia is either a partner or an adversary. There’s no way for the West to continue containing Russia and maintaining a good relationship with it at the same time. Russia already gave it too much time, despite putting itself at an obvious disadvantage because, as we can see, the West took advantage of this time to keep treating Russia as an economy and a political and military force to contain. I hope Moscow won’t allow that ever again,”</em> Bruter commented.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.03/thumbnail/642033b685f54068f448961c.jpg\" alt=\"RT\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/573616-cossack-from-djibouti/\">A Cossack from Djibouti: How a Russian con man founded a colony in Africa</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>Sergey Oznobishchev believes that although Finland’s accession to NATO is against Russia’s long-term interests, it does not pose any immediate or overwhelming threat. A lot will depend on how well Moscow and Helsinki will work on salvaging the relationship the two nations used to enjoy. According to Oznobishchev, they have a solid foundation to help them with that, i.e. <em>“all those decades of friendship and good neighborly relationship with Helsinki.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Now is a good time to start working on this,”</em> he argued. <em>“It’s time to focus on stabilizing Russia’s relationship with Finland and Sweden while we have anything that can still be saved. So far these two nations haven’t been overly unfriendly. The matter of essence for Russia is that they don’t let their territories be used by NATO to increase its military presence and to build up military capabilities.”</em></p>\n<p>According to Alexander Khramchikhin, Russia's relations with all Western countries have deteriorated so much that<em> \"the next stage can only be a direct war, which is not likely to happen.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>“I think that we need to continue the endless whining about the restoration of relations with the West. It will never happen, and we need to understand this,” </em>he said.</p>\n",

The paper’s anonymous sources stressed that <em>“no American or British nationals were involved”</em> in the sabotage of the key energy infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The vessel, which had allegedly been rented by the perpetrators to carry out the attack, was soon identified as the yacht Andromeda. The boat is now sitting in dry dock overlooking the Baltic Sea in north-eastern Germany, with<em> “its innards pulled out by investigators,”</em> the NYT said.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure><img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2023.04/thumbnail/642eb80885f5405b8e58a684.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: A worker at the construction site of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/574292-nords-stream-state-actor/\">State actor is ‘main scenario’ in Nord Stream sabotage – investigator</a></figcaption></figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>Kremlin press-secretary Dmitry Peskov suggested earlier that the articles about Andromeda’s involvement were distributed by the Western media in order to divert attention from the report by veteran American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, which came shortly before the Western media reports and blamed Washington for the sabotage.</p>\n<p>According to an informed source who talked with Hersh, explosives were planted on the pipelines in the Baltic Sea back in June 2022 by US Navy divers during a NATO exercise, and detonated remotely two months later on the order of American leader Joe Biden. The White House has rejected as <em>“utterly false and complete fiction”</em> the findings of the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist</p>\n<p>In its report on Friday, the NYT also quoted Johannes Riber, a naval officer and analyst at Denmark’s Institute for Strategy and War Studies, who also questioned claims of a 50-foot (15-meter) yacht being capable of carrying out an attack of such scale, likening them to a <em>“James Bond”</em> theory.</p>\n<p>Andromeda could’ve well been a decoy or part of a broader mission, Riber suggested. But planting powerful explosives at the pipelines would’ve likely required an undersea drone or a mini-submarine, and a professional ship to transport it, he pointed out.</p>\n\n             \n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/574108-nord-stream-investigations-wapo/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>West ‘not so eager to find out’ who bombed Nord Stream – WaPo\n        </a>\n    </p>\n\n\n    \n\n<p>However, the article also contained comments by an unnamed pipeline expert and a professional diver, who both claimed that small bombs could’ve been enough to cripple the infrastructure if they were placed near a seam of the pipeline.</p>\n",
